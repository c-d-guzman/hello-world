# hello-world

Hello fellow programers,

A little bit about myself... I am a college student with a great interest and admiration for technology. I am eager to learn about everything programming makes possible and to contribute new programs, tools and entertainment to the world. I am learning html and css from a free online course and am learning how to create games using unity app. I am interested in the up and coming technology that makes virtual realities possible and creating some virtual realities of my own. I currently have intermediate knoledge of python but, need practical use of it to achieve mastery. An accomplishment while using python was the creation of a unit converter. At the moment I am applying for an internship with facebook so that I can learn more about the development of phone apps and apply the knowledge obtained to create a phone app of my own.
